## Hypothesis
The project focuses on creating an algorithmic trading system with a specific emphasis on FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google). The primary objective is to conduct thorough backtesting and market analysis using historical data of these stocks. By employing various trading models, the project aims to develop accurate predictions and optimize trading strategies. Technical indicators such as Simple Moving Average (SMA) and logistic regression are utilized to enhance the models' predictive capabilities. Through extensive backtesting and model development, the project seeks to identify buy or sell signals for each FAANG stock, enabling informed trading decisions. The ultimate goal is to create a robust and effective algorithmic trading system that can generate profitable results based on market analysis and strategy optimization.  <br>
